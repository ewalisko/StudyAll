      Suppose you are building a course registration system for a university.
      One possible design of the <code>Professor</code> and <code>Student

      <img src="person01.png" />

      Another possible design of the <code>Professor</code> and <code>Student

    <answer>

      <p>
      The second design is certainly better. The first design will have 
      considerable code duplication. The second recognizes that both 
      <code>Professor</code> objects and <code>Student</code> objects
      have something in common -- they are <code>Person</code> objects.

      It says that you should use consistent terminology, icons, colors,
      etc... It is motivated by the capacity of working memory and the fact
      that rehearsal slows decay.
